The Rest API is also deployed on heroku: https://census-ml.herokuapp.com/

Notice: Since heroku-github sync is currently not available due to security issues, the heroku git solution with two remotes was used (see https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2413 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71892543/heroku-and-github-items-could-not-be-retrieved-internal-server-error)
