# Udacity MLOps Project 3: Census Data ML module

## Environment Setup
* Download and install conda if you don’t have it already.
    * Use the supplied requirements file to create a new environment, or
    * conda create -n [envname] "python=3.8" scikit-learn dvc pandas numpy pytest jupyter jupyterlab fastapi uvicorn -c conda-forge
    * In order to install the package in development mode (e.g. needed for testing) run <br>``pip install -e .``


## API Creation

* Create a RESTful API using FastAPI this must implement:
   * GET on the root giving a welcome message.
   * POST that does model inference.
   * Type hinting must be used.
   * Use a Pydantic model to ingest the body from POST. This model should contain an example.
    * Hint: the data has names with hyphens and Python does not allow those as variable names. Do not modify the column names in the csv and instead use the functionality of FastAPI/Pydantic/etc to deal with this.
* Write 3 unit tests to test the API (one for the GET and two for POST, one that tests each prediction).

## API Deployment

* Create a free Heroku account (for the next steps you can either use the web GUI or download the Heroku CLI).
* Create a new app and have it deployed from your GitHub repository.
   * Enable automatic deployments that only deploy if your continuous integration passes.
   * Hint: think about how paths will differ in your local environment vs. on Heroku.
   * Hint: development in Python is fast! But how fast you can iterate slows down if you rely on your CI/CD to fail before fixing an issue. I like to run flake8 locally before I commit changes.
* Set up DVC on Heroku using the instructions contained in the starter directory.
* Set up access to AWS on Heroku, if using the CLI: `heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyy`
* Write a script that uses the requests module to do one POST on your live API.
